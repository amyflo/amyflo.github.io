							<h1>üì≤ Slack Calls</h1>
							<h2>Reimagining work calls through user research and design.</h2>
							<p>I‚Äôm a major fan of Slack and use it constantly for work, projects, and team building. I consider Slack essential to my remote workflow. But the one thing I haven‚Äôt found myself doing is making Slack calls. Prior to this project, I made less than five calls on Slack! Although Slack has been vital to my work communications, I find that most of my virtual meetings pivot to using other platforms, even if we are on the Standard or Enterprise plans.</p>
							<p>Because of COVID-19, I understand how important calls are to remote work. They help us stay connected with each other and give us the human connection that we&#39;ve all been missing during the quarantine. Slack has already helped thousands of Americans transition to remote work ‚Äì <mark>they just need better Slack Calls to make the switch even easier.</mark> </p>

				<p>Redesigning Slack calls needs background on the way Slack operates. Slack&#39;s mission statement is <mark>&quot;Making work simpler, more pleasant, and more productive,&quot;</mark> and they&#39;ve made strides to make work even easier during the pandemic when remote work surged because of stay-at-home orders.</p>
				<p>From their <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/report-remote-work-during-coronavirus">research in March</a>, Slack found that: </p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					<ul>
						<li>45% of knowledge workers surveyed work remotely</li>
						<li>66% of remote workers are doing so because of Covid-19 concerns</li>
						<li>27% of remote workers say they ‚Äúnormally‚Äù work from home</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Remote work in the age of COVID-19 is already difficult enough because tnof distanced communication, team restructuring, and increased health risks for family members and loved ones. Technology and tools should serve to ease burdens between remote work, and <mark>Slack calls should strive to be part of the solution.</mark> </p>

				<p>There is a huge opportunity for <mark>Slack to refine existing features and imagine new calling features that can integrate into the remote work experience.</mark> Slack‚Äôs current business model is to offer users a limited number of features for free and encourage them to purchase Standard or Enterprise users to access advanced features and functionalities. </p>

				<p>I interviewed two groups of people ‚Äì Free and Standard plan users. I used a combination of interview questions and usability tests to learn more about remote work challenges and gauge overall familiarity with the Slack product. </p>

					<h3>User Interviews</h3>
					<p>I sought out interviews from two groups: Free and Standard users. I wanted to examine how these different customer bases interacted with Slack calls.
					For the Free group, I invited them into a new Slack workspace I created for this challenge and asked them to explore Slack call‚Äôs basic functions by receiving and making a call. For the Standard users, I asked them to do the same task, but also test sharing their screens. </p>

				<h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h3>
				<p>While I found 18 key themes throughout my interviews around Slack notifications, remote work, and post-call features, I chose to focus on the five core themes that formed the basis of my redesign.</p>
				
				<button class="accordion">üí° Ingrained features could be simplified and other functionalities and options can grow.</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						"I was not very impressed with the obviousness of the various features. I would not know most of these features exist.&quot;  - Holden
					</blockquote>
					<p>To make Slack more intuitive for the user, it&#39;d be important to add in additional functions and simplify native features, like making pinning people in calls easier and making the settings more understandable.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">üí° Our productivity in calls could benefit from integrated Slack apps.</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p>&quot;I almost always have Slack open... it would feel more like useful if [Slack Calls] had more has the features we talked about that would make it like more productive and more oriented for work.&quot; - Charlie</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Adding apps for users in the Standard or Enterprise plan provides a market incentive for users to switch to Slack. If users like using a tool together, they would be more inclined to pay for the ability to integrate apps cross-functionally</p>		
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">üí° We want to see messages for longer, not see them disappear.</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like how reactions just disappear... Especially if it&#39;s regarding business, I feel like you&#39;d want that record...I don&#39;t think you can review it, at least from what I can see.&quot; - Julianna</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>From usability testing, none of the participants I interviewed could initially figure out how to send a message on Slack calls without guidance, and all were frustrated with the disappearing messages. Creating a chat panel instead of reactions that stored messages would make it easier to chat freely without worrying that their message would disappear before someone else sees it.</p>				
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">üí° We&#39;d like more features and options while sharing our screen.</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p>&quot;While you&#39;re screen sharing, being able to get a broader note or greater idea of what the participants in the call are doing would really, really help.&quot; - Sathya</p>
					</blockquote>		
					<p>Sharing screens currently have only one option on Slack calls to draw on them. While this is helpful, drawing does fade away, and it could be difficult to make points or remember where exactly you drew unless you were able to save that information.</p>				
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">üí° We want recordings, breakout rooms, and customizations.</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p>"Recording is a must... maybe a team member is absent and you want to record instead of taking meeting notes so that they can actually see everything that's happening." - Haixin</p>
					</blockquote>		
					<p>Including recordings on Slack calls <mark>would be extremely helpful as a way to keep track and log what occurs during meetings.</mark></p>	
					
					<blockquote>
						<p>"The biggest thing that Zoom really struggles with is breakout rooms and how to group people. So I think if Slack wants to have some sort of edge over the competition in that sense, that's where." - Nicole
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Breakout rooms are popular because they allow you to <mark>easily communicate in small groups during meetings and would be especially helpful for socializing,** an important aspect of the Slack environment.</mark>
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, additional customizations can <mark>make a Slack call feel more personal to a user and accommodate for a diverse set of needs and desires.</mark>

				<ul>
					<li>Redesigning Slack calls also helped me gain a better understanding and appreciation for the work that it takes to envision a product from start to finish.</li>
					<li>I learned a lot about the process that it takes to think through different features, integrate user feedback, and analyze critical product features in the market!</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
				<p>I would love to continue to iterate by building out the notifications for incoming and outgoing Slack calls using the other key insights that I found through my user research. It would be extremely interesting to see <mark>how users can make calls easier and more quickly through Slack</mark>, and whether the location and ease of access to making a call would <mark>change their engagement with Slack.</mark> </p>
				<p>Because of my experience working with front-end development, <mark>I would love to gain experience building the UI for some of these features in this design challenge</mark> with Slack&#39;s software engineering team.</p>
