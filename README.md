# Portfolio Website

## About
This repository hosts my personal portfolio and will showcase my design work, to launch in 2021 on <a href="amyflo.com.">amyflo.com</a>. 

## Motivation
I wanted to practice skills in front-end development, so this is the first website that I plan to design completely from scratch! I am in the process of teaching myself how to code – this is how I plan on implementing and honing those skills!

## Tools
This project will be built through a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Design is created in Figma and planning on using a few JS libraries. 

## Work
Please do not reshare graphics, designs, illustrated and/or related work from the website without my express permission, authorization and credit!
